2 roles: admin, customer
start at the admin page first
1. check all records of the bookings
2. can search the record through the search function
	search Tom
	search Phone number, 94
the records are ordered by the newest date

Sure we can edit the booking record
Lets say we found we input the false time of Micheal's booking
It should be 6pm instead of 6am
so we changed it through the edit function

next we can create the booking through the create function 
Lets say Kaitlyn, 12345678, 7pm today.


The customer can check their booking. 
Lets have a look of the customer page.
